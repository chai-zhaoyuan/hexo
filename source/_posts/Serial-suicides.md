There's been another of those 'serial suicides'. It's weird. There doesn't seem to be any connection between the deceased. It doesn't make sense.

Met up with Bill Murray. Not the film star. He was the nurse who saved my life when I was shot. He's got married.

Stuff's happening to other people.
